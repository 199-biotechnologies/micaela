                  <p>
                    I&apos;ve built my career around a passion for both interior design and real estate.
                    After graduating in Interior Design and becoming a qualified real estate agent in 2011,
                    I&apos;ve had the joy of blending these two fields to offer a unique and personalized
                    approach to property services.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Based here in Ibiza, I take pride in truly understanding my clients&apos; needsâ€”not just
                    on a practical level, but by focusing on building meaningful relationships. Along with
                    my team, I help clients from diverse backgrounds find properties that perfectly align
                    with their lifestyles.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We offer a full range of services, from real estate and legal guidance to interior design
                    and construction advice, all designed to make your property experience smooth and stress-free.
                    If you&apos;re looking for a professional who truly listens and values personalized service,
                    I&apos;d love to help you find the perfect property.
